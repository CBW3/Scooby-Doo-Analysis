# Scooby-Doo-Analysis
I analyze a large dataset pertaining to the Scooby-Doo Universe.

The dataset contains ~700 rows & ~75 columns. The information in the dataset contains Series Name, Network, Season, Title,
IMDB Ratings, Engagement Figures, Culprit Information, Unique Dialogue Figures, etc. 

This was an exploratory data analysis exercise, so I developed questions I would like to answer over time. 

The dataset was very "messy" & akin to a real world dataset you might deal with as analyst. 

Throughout this exercise, I constantly cleaned, transformed, and wrangled the data to make into something more usable for my analytical tasks.

As an illustration, I wanted to explore the relationship between Networks & IMDB Ratings, Networks & Unique Dialogue Counts, 
IMDB Ratings & Format, among many other questions. 

In doing so, I primarily used R for my analysis. Using R, I utilized a variety of different packages & functions, including 
TidyTuesdayR, Tidyverse, ggplot, and other functionalities to perform statistical tests like an ANOVA test. 

After my analysis in R, I wanted to further extrapolite my analysis findings by moving towards Tableau. 

In Tableau, I created a Dashboard as well as produced a variety of illustrations.

During my Tableau exercise, I used advanced concepts like calculated fields, formatting the worksheet, and providing labels and colors.

I really enjoyed this exercise, and I am proud of my analysis. I believe it shows that I can accomplish an analytical task with very little supervision.
Similarly, I can answer interesting & novel questions by using my toolkit of applied statistics & software packages. 

For futher details, please refer to the Word Document in this repository. There, I document my motivations, my thought process, and my findings. 
Likewise, please refer to the Tableau link provided in the text file of this Repository to visually explore my findings & further analysis for yourself.
